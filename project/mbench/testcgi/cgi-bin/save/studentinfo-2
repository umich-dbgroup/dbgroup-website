I wanted to take EECS584 this semester because I'm interested in the subject matter and I hoped it would give me a good indication if I would like to pursue research in Data Management especially related to some of the problems faced in Bioinformatics.  From the description of the course you gave today in class I think it will be very beneficial to take this class in order to prepare for doing research in both Computer Science and Bioinformatics.
