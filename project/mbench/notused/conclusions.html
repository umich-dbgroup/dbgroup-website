<BODY >
We proposed a benchmark that can be used to identify individual
data characteristics and operations that may affect the performance of XML
query processing engines.  With careful analysis of the benchmark queries,
engineers can diagnose the strengths and weaknesses of their XML databases,
and, thus, be able to improve the performance. 

<P>
We evaluated a native XML database, TIMBER, and a commercial
Object-Relational database using this benchmark and found places where
each had substantial room for improvement.  The benchmark has already become
an invaluable tool in the development of the TIMBER native XML database,
helping us to identify bad implementation on our part (for instance, TIMBER's
poor performance for a linear scan in QR3).
