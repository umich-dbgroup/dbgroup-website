For relational systems, the
Wisconsin benchmark~\cite{wiss} provided the database community
with an invaluable engineering tool to assess the performance of
individual operators and access methods. The work presented in this 
paper is inspired by the simplicity and the effectiveness of the 
Wisconsin benchmark for measuring and understanding the performance 
of relational DBMSs. The goal of this paper is to 
develop a comparable benchmarking tool for XML data management systems. 
The benchmark that we propose to achieve this goal is called the 
Michigan benchmark.
