Structural Selection</A>
</H3>
Selection in XML is often based on patterns.  Queries should be
constructed to consider multi-node patterns of various sorts, and with
various selectivities.  An issue that arises is that of ``conditional
selectivity.'' Consider a simple two node selection pattern. Given
that one of the nodes has been identified, conditioned upon this fact,
the selectivity of the second node can be very different than its
selectivity in the database as a whole.  (One could, of course, have
similar dependencies between different attributes in a relation,
thereby affecting the selectivity of a multi-attribute predicate.
Matters are more complicated in XML because these different attributes
may not be in the same tuple, but rather in different, but
structurally related, elements.)  These dependencies can be modeled
by having the ``cyclic numbering'' schemes with different moduli, as
in the Wisconsin benchmark.

Two other data structural parameters are important for tree-structured
data, such as XML. These are fanout and depth. Let us look at the
issue of depth first. The depth of the data tree can have a
significant performance impact when we are computing
ancestor-descendant (or containment) relationships.  It is possible
that the containment is very distant (not an immediate child), and it
is also possible to have multiple nodes at different levels satisfying
the ancestor and the descendant predicates.  Similarly the fanout of
the data tree can have an impact on the way in which the DBMS stores
the data in the DBMS, and answers queries that are based on selecting
children in a specific order (for example select the last child).

One potential way of testing these parameters (fanout and depth) is to
generate a number of distinct data sets with different values for each
of these parameters and then run queries against each data set. The
drawback of this approach is that we have to deal with a large number
of data sets which makes the benchmark harder to run and to
understand. Rather, the approach that we take in this proposal is to
create a base benchmark data set of depth 16. Then, using a ``level''
attribute, we can restrict the scope of the query to data sets of
certain depth, thereby, quantifying the impact of the depth of the
data tree.

To study the impact of fanout, we generate the data set in the
following way. Each level in the tree (recall there are 16 levels) has
a fanout of 2, except for levels 5, 6, 7, and 8. The levels 5, 6, and
7 have a fanout of 4, where as level 8 has a fanout of 1/4 (at level 8
every fourth node has a single child). This variation in fanout is
designed to permit queries that focus on this one factor in isolation.
For instance, the number of nodes at levels 7 and 9 is 256. Nodes at
level 7 have a fanout of 4, whereas the nodes at level 9 have a fanout
of 2. Queries against these two levels can be used to measure the
impact of fanout.
