<title>The Michigan Benchmark: Abstract<</title>
</head>

<body>
We propose a <EM>micro-benchmark</EM> for XML data management to aid
engineers in designing improved XML processing engines.  This
benchmark is inherently different from application-level benchmarks,
which are designed to help users choose between alternative products.
We primarily attempt to capture the rich variety of data structures
and distribution possible in XML, and to isolate their effects,
without imitating any particular application.  The benchmark specifies
a single data set against which carefully specified queries can be
used to evaluate system performance for XML data with various
characteristics. We have used the benchmark to test and analyze the
performance of different XML database system implementations.
