<H1>Query Selectivity Computation</H1>
<P>
Each of the benchmark queries was carefully chosen to have a desired selectivity. In this appendix, we describe
the computation of these selectivities, analytically.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, we will frequently need to determine the probability of "PickWord", based on the uniform
distribution of buckets and words in each bucket, as described in Section 3. 3. For example, if "PickWord" is
"oneB1", this indicates that this "PickWord" is the first word in bucket 1. Since there are 16 buckets, and there
is only one word in the first bucket the probability of "oneB1" being picked is 1/ 16 (1=16  1). Since there are
eight words in the fourth bucket (2 4 ), the probability of "oneB4" being picked is 1/ 128 (1=16  1=8).
</P>
<P>
<B>QR1-QR4. </B>Select all elements with aSixtyFour =1. These queries have a selectivity of 1/ 64 (1.6%) since
they are selected based on aSixtyFour attribute which has a probability of 1/ 64.
<P>
<B>QS1. </B>Select nodes with aString = "Sing a song of oneB4". Selectivity is 1/ 128 (0.8%) since the probability
of "oneB4" is 1/ 128.
<P>
<B>QS2. </B>Select nodes with aString = "Sing a song of oneB1". Selectivity is 1/ 16 (6.3%) since the probability
of "oneB1" is 1/ 16.
<P>
<B>QS3. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 10. Selectivity is 0.7% since the number of nodes at level 10 is 0.7% of
the number of total nodes in the document.
<P>
<B>QS4. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 13. Selectivity is 6.0% since the number of nodes at level 13 is 6.0% of
the number of total nodes in the document.
<P>
<B>QS5. </B>Select nodes with aSixtyFour between 5 and 8. Selectivity is 4 x 1/64 = 1/16 (6.3%).
<P>
<B>QS6. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 13 and have the returned nodes sorted by aSixtyFour attribute. Selectivity
is 6.0%.
<P>
<B>QS7. </B>Select nodes with attributes aSixteen = 1 and aFour = 1. Selectivity is 1/16 x 1/4 = 1/64 (1.6)%
sine the selectivity of nodes with aLevel = 13 is 6.0%.
<P>
<B>QS8. </B>Select nodes based on the element name, eOccasional. Selectivity is 1/64 (1.6%) since eOccasional
appears nested under the element with aSixtyFour = 0 and the probability of aSixtyFour = 0 is 1/16.
<P>
<B>QS9. </B>Select the second child of every node with aLevel = 7. At level 7, each node has thirteen children.
These children are at level 8 which has the number of nodes = 4.8% of all nodes. Thus, the selectivity of this
query is 4.8% x 1/13 = 0.4%.
<P>
<B>QS10. </B>Select the second child of every node with aLevel = 9. At level 9, each node has two children. These
children are at level 10 which has the number of nodes = 0.7% of all nodes. Thus, the selectivity of this query is
0.7% x 1/ 2 = 0.4%.
<P>
<B>QS11. </B>Select OccasionalType nodes that have "oneB4" in the element content. Since there is approximately
one OccasionalType node in every 64 BaseType nodes, the overall selectivity is (16/128) x (1/64) =
1/512 (0.2%).
<P>
<B>QS12. </B>Select nodes that have "oneB4" as substring in element content. The probability of "oneB4" being
picked 1/ 128. Although this string can also arise in bucket 16, the probability there is much smaller 2  ,and
hence can be ignored. There are 16 "PickWord" s in the content of each element, so 16 opportunities for this
predicate to be satisfied at each element, giving an overall selectivity of 16/128 (12.5%).
<P>
<B>QS13. </B>Select all nodes with element content that the distance between keyword "oneB5" and keyword
"twenty" is not more than four. The probability of any one occurrence of "oneB5" being selected is 1/256.
Thus, the overall selectivity is (1/256) x 2 = 1/128 (0.8%).
<P>
<B>QS14. </B>Select all nodes with element content that the distance between keyword "oneB2" and keyword
"twenty" is not more than four. There are two occurrences of "PickWord" within four words of "twenty" and
14 occurrences that are further away. The probability of any one occurrence of "oneB2" being selected is 1/32.
Thus, the overall selectivity is (1/32) x 2 =1/16 (6.3%).
<P>
<B>QS15. </B>Select the second element below each element with aFour = 1 if that second element also has aFour
=1. 
Let n<SUB>l</SUB> be the number
of nodes at level l and f<SUB>l</SUB> be the number of fanout at
level l-1. Then, the number of the second element
nodes is &sum;<SUP align="right">l=16</SUP><SUB align="right">l=2</SUB> (n<SUB>l
</SUB>) x (1/f<SUB>l-1</SUB>) which is approximately 1/2.

<P>
Since the selectivity of the element with aFour =1 is
1/ 4, the probability that the second element that has
aFour = 1 and that its parent has aFour = 1 is 1/16.
Thus, the overall selectivity of this query is (1/2) x
(1/16) = 1/32 (3.1%).
</P>
<B>QS16. </B>Select the second element with aFour = 1 below any element with aSixtyFour = 1. This query
returns at most one element.
<P>
<B>QS17. </B>Among the children with aSixteen = 1 of the parent element with aLevel = 13, select the last one.
Approximately 5.95% of the nodes are at level 13, and each has two children. Almost 1/ 8 of these will have at
least one child that satisfies the former predicate (from among whom the last one must be returned in this query).
Thus, the overall query selectivity is 0.0595 x 1/8 = 0.7%.
<P>
<B>QS18. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 13 that have a child with aSixteen = 3. The first predicate has a
selectivity of 5.95%, and the second predicate has a selectivity of 1/16. Since each node at level 13 has two
children, there are two opportunities to satisfy the child predicate. Therefore the overall selectivity of this query
is 0.0595 x (1/16) x 2 = 0.7%.
<P>
<B>QS19. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 15 that have a child with aSixtyFour = 3. The first predicate has a
selectivity of 23.78%, and the second predicate has a selectivity of 1/ 64. Following the same argument as above,
the selectivity of the query as a whole is still 0.7%.
<P>
<B>QS20. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 11 that have a child with aFour = 3. The first predicate has a selectivity
of 1.49%, and the second predicate has a selectivity of 1/ 4. Following the same argument as above, the selectivity
of the query as a whole is still 0.7%.
<P>
<B>QS21. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 13 that have a descendant with aSixteen = 3. The first predicate has
selectivity of 0.0595. 
Since each node at level 13 has
14 descendants, the probability that none of these 14
nodes satisfy the second predicate is (1 - (1/16))<SUP>14</SUP>.
Thus, the probability that a given selected ancestor
node has any descendant that satisfies the second predicate
is 1 (1 - (1/16))<SUP>14</SUP>. Therefore, the overall
selectivity is 0.0595 x (1 - (1 - (1/16))<SUP>14</SUP>) = 3.5%.
<P>
<B>QS22. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 15 that have a descendant with aSixtyFour = 3. The first predicate
has selectivity of 0.24. 
Since a node at
level 15 only has no descendant other than its own
two children, the probability that none of these two
nodes satisfy the second predicate is (1 - (1/64))<SUP>2</SUP>.
The overall selectivity is 0.24 x (1 - (1 - (1/64))<SUP>2</SUP>)
=0.7%.
</P>

<B>QS23. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 11 that have a descendant with aFour = 3. The first predicate has
selectivity of 1.5. 
Since each level 11 node
has 62 descendants, the probability that none of these
62 nodes satisfy the second predicate is (1 - (1/4))<SUP>62</SUP>.
The selectivity of the query as a whole is 1.5 x (1 -
(1 - (1/4))<SUP>62</SUP>) = 1.5%.  Selectivity is 1.5%.
</P>
<P>
<B>QS28. </B>This query is to test the choice of join order in evaluating a complex query. To achieve the desired
selectivities, we use the following predicates: aFour =3, aSixteen= 3, aSixteen= 5 and aLevel= 16. The prob-ability
of aFour = 3 is 1/4, and of aSixteen = 3(5) is 1/16, and the probability of aLevel = 16 is 0.47. Thus,
the selectivity of this query is 1/4 x 1/16 x 1/16 x 0.47 = 0.0%.
<P>
<B>QS29. </B>Select parent nodes with aLevel= 11 that have a child with aFour= 3, and another child with
aSixtyFour= 3. The probability of aLevel= 11 is 0.015, that of aFour= 3 is 1/4, and that of aSixtyFour= 3 is
1/64. Thus, the selectivity of this query is 0.015 x 1/4 x 1/64 = 0.0%.
<P>
<B>QS30. </B>Select parent nodes with aFour= 1 that have a child with aLevel= 11 and another child with aSix-tyFour=
3. The probability of aFour= 1 is 0.25, that of aLevel= 11 is 0.015, and that of aSixtyFour= 3 is 1/64.
Thus, the selectivity of this query is 0.25 x 0.015 x 1/64 = 0.0%.
<P>
<B>QS32. </B>Select nodes with aLevel = 11 that have a descendant with aFour =3 and another descendant with
aSixtyFour = 3. The first predicate has selectivity of 0.015. 
Since a node at level 11 has 62 descendants. The probability
that one of these descendants satisfy aFour= 3
and aS ixtyFour = 3 are 1 62 and 1
(1=64)) 62 ), respectively. Thus, the overall selectivity
is 0.015 x (1 - (1 - (1/4))<SUP>62</SUP>) x (1 - (1 - (1/64))<SUP>62</SUP> )
=0.9%.
<P>
<B>QJ1. </B>Select nodes with aSixtyFour = 2 and join with themselves based on the equality of aUnique1
attribute. The probability of aSixtyFour = 2 is 1/64, thus the selectivity of this query is 1/64 (1.6%).
<P>
<B>QJ2. </B>Select nodes with aSixteen = 2 and join with themselves based on the equality of aLevel attribute.
The probability of aSixteen = 2 is 1/ 16, thus the selectivity of this query is 1/ 16 (6.3%).
<P>
<B>QJ3. </B>Select all OccasionalType nodes that point to a node with aSixtyFour =3. This query returns 1/64
of all the OccasionalType nodes, and the probability of OccasionalType nodes is 1/64. Thus, the selectivity
of this query is 1/64 x 1/64 = 1/4096 (0.02%).
<P>
<B>QJ4. </B>Select all OccasionalType nodes that point to a node with aFour =3. This query returns 1/ 4 of all the
eOccasional nodes, and the probability of OccasionalType nodes is 1/ 64. Thus, the selectivity of this query
is 1/4 x 1/64 = 1/256 (0.4%).
<P>
<B>QA1. </B>Compute the average value for the aSixtyFour attribute for all nodes at level 15. This query returns
only one node which contains the average value.
<P>
<B>QA2. </B>Compute the average value for the aSixtyFour attribute for all nodes at each level. This query returns
16 nodes which contains the average values for 16 levels.
<P>
<B>QA3. </B>Amongst the nodes at level 11, find the node( s) with the largest fanout. 1/64 of the nodes are at level
11. Most nodes at this level have exactly two children. But 1/64 of these nodes also have a third child, of type
eOccasional. These are the nodes that must be returned. Thus, selectivity is 1/64 x 1/64 = 1/4096 (0.02%).
<P>
<B>QA4. </B>Select elements that have at least two occurrences of keyword "oneB1" in their content. There are
16 "PickWord" s in the element content. The probability that "PickWord" is replaced with "oneB1" is 1/16, and
the probability that "PickWord" is not replaced with "oneB1" is 15/ 16. 
Let P<SUB>n</SUB>("oneB1") be the probability
that there are n occurrences of "oneB1." Then,
P<SUB>n</SUB>("oneB1") = (16 CHOOSE n) x (1/16)<SUP>n</SUP> x (15/16)<SUP>16-n</SUP>. The probability
that there are at least two occurrences of "oneB1" is
1 - P<SUB>0</SUB>("oneB1") - P<SUB>1</SUB>("oneB1") = 1 - 0.36 -0.38 = 0.26.
Thus, the selectivity of this query is 0.26%.
<P>
<B>QA5. </B>Select elements that have at least two children that satisfy aFour = 1. About 50% of the database
nodes are at level 16 and have no children. Except about 2% of the remainder, all have exactly two children,
and both must satisfy the predicate for the node to qualify. The selectivity of the predicate is 1/4. So the overall
selectivity of this query is (1/2) x (1/4) x (1/4) = 1/32 (3.1%)
<P>
<B>QA6. </B>For each node at level 7, determine the height of the sub-tree rooted at this node. Nodes at level 7 are
0.4% of all nodes, thus the selectivity of this query is 0.4%.
