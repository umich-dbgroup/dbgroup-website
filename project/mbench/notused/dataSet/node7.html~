Generating the String Attributes and Element Content
</H2>
The content of the elements in the benchmark is a long string.  Since
this long string is meant to simulate a piece of text in a natural
language, it is not appropriate to generate this string from a uniform
distribution.  Yet, selecting pieces of text from real sources
introduces all manners of difficulty - how to maintain roughly
constant size for each string, how to avoid idiosyncrasies associated
with the specific source, how to generate more strings as required for
a scaled benchmark, and so on.  Moreover, we would like to have
benchmark results applicable to a wide variety of languages and domain
vocabularies.
<BR/>
<BR/>
To address the above desiderata, we generate these long strings
synthetically, in a carefully stylized manner.  We begin by creating a
pool of  (a little over sixty thousand)
words<A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="footnode.html#foot87"><SUP><IMG  ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="1" ALT="[*]"
 SRC="icons/footnote.png"></SUP></A> synthetic words as follows. The words
are divided into 16 buckets, with exponentially growing bucket
occupancy.  The first bucket has only one word, the second has two
words, the third has 4, and so on.  Bucket  has  words.
The words are not words from the English (or any other) language.
Rather, they are synthetically created, with each word containing
information about the bucket from which it is drawn and the word
number in the bucket.  For example, ``15twentynineB14'' indicates that
this is the 1,529th word from the fourteenth bucket.  To keep the size
of the vocabulary at roughly 30,000, words in the last bucket are
derived from words in the other buckets by adding the suffix ``ing''
(to get exactly  words in the sixteenth bucket, we add the
dummy word ``oneB0ing'').
<BR/>
<BR/>
The value for the long string is generated from the following
template, where ``PickWord'' is actually a placeholder for words
picked from the word pool described above.  To pick a word for
``PickWord'', a bucket is chosen, with each bucket equally likely, and
then a word is chosen from within the bucket, with each word equally
likely. Thus, we obtain a discrete Zipf distribution of parameter
roughly 1.  We use the Zipf distribution since it seems to reflect
word occurrence probabilities accurately in a wide variety of
situations.

The string attribute is simply the first line of the large string that
is stored as the element content.
