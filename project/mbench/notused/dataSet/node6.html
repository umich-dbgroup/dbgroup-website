Generating the String Attributes and Element Content
</H2>

<P>
The element content of each <I>BaseType</I> element is a long
string. Since this string is meant to simulate a piece of text in
a natural language, it is not appropriate to generate this string
from a uniform distribution. 
Selecting pieces of text from real sources, however,
involves many difficulties, such as how to maintain roughly
constant size for each string, how to avoid idiosyncrasies associated
with the specific source, and how to generate more strings as required for
a scaled benchmark.
  Moreover, we would like to have
benchmark results applicable to a wide variety of languages and domain
vocabularies.

<P>
To obtain the string value that has the distribution similar to the distribution of a natural language text, we generate these long strings
synthetically, in a carefully stylized manner.  We begin by creating a
pool of  (over sixty thousands)
 synthetic words. The words
are divided into 16 buckets, with exponentially growing bucket
occupancy.
Bucket  has  words.
For example, the first bucket has only one word, the second has two
words, the third has four words, and so on.
The words are not meaningful in  any language,
	but simply contains
information about the bucket from which it is drawn and the word
number in the bucket.
For example, ``15twentynineB14'' indicates that
this is the 1,529th word from the fourteenth bucket.  To keep the size
of the vocabulary in the last bucket at roughly 30,000 words, words
in the last bucket are
derived from words in the other buckets by adding the suffix ``ing''
(to get exactly  words in the sixteenth bucket, we add the
dummy word ``oneB0ing'').

<P>
The value of the long string is generated from
the template shown below.
<CENTER>
<TABLE CLASS="eg" WIDTH="60%" BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="5" BGCOLOR="#99FFFF">

<PRE>
   Sing a song of PickWord,
   A pocket full of PickWord
   Four and twenty PickWord
   All baked in a PickWord.

   When the PickWord was opened,
   The PickWord began to sing;
   Wasn't that a dainty PickWord
   To set before the PickWord?

   The King was in his PickWord,
   Counting out his PickWord;
   The Queen was in the PickWord
   Eating bread and PickWord.

   The maid was in the PickWord
   Hanging out the PickWord;
   When down came a PickWord,
   And snipped off her PickWord!

``PickWord'' is actually a placeholder for a word
picked from the word pool described above.  To pick a word for
``PickWord'', a bucket is chosen, with each bucket equally likely, and
then a word is picked from the chosen bucket, with each word equally
likely. Thus, we obtain a discrete Zipf distribution of parameter
roughly 1.  We use the Zipf distribution since it seems to reflect
word occurrence probabilities accurately in a wide variety of
situations.
The value of <I>aString</I> attribute is simply the first line of the long string that
is stored as the element content.

<P>
Through the above procedures, we now have the data set that has the structure
that facilitates the study of the impact of data characteristics on
system performance and the element/attribute content that simulates a piece
of text in a natural language.
