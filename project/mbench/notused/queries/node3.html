Simple Selection Queries</A>
</H3>

<P>
Even XML queries involving only one element and a single predicate can show
considerable diversity.  We examine the effect of this single selection
predicate in this set of queries.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Exact Match Attribute Value Selection</B> 
<BR><B>Selection based on the value of a string attribute.</B> 
<B>QS1.</B> High selectivity: select nodes with <I>aString = ``Sing a song of oneB1''</I>. Since the probability of <I>``oneB1''</I> is 1/16, this query has 
a selectivity of 1/16 (6.2%). 

<P>
<B>QS2.</B> Low selectivity: select nodes with <I>aString = ``Sing a song of oneB4''</I>. Since the probability of <I>``oneB4''</I> is 1/128, this query has
a selectivity of 1/128 (0.8%).  
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>Selection based on the value of an integer attribute.</B> 
<BR>
We reproduce
the same selectivities as in the string attribute case.   

<P>
<B>QS3.</B> High selectivity: select nodes with 
<I>aLevel = 13</I>.   Since the number of nodes at level 13 is 6.0% of all nodes in the document, the selectivity of this query is 6.0%. 

<P>
<B>QS4.</B> Low selectivity: select nodes with 
<I>aLevel = 10</I>.  Since the number of nodes at level 10 is 0.7% of all nodes in the document, the selectivity of this query is 0.7%. 

<P>
<B>Selection on range values.</B> 
<BR><B>QS5.</B> Select nodes with <I>aSixtyFour</I> between 5 and 8. Selectivity
is <!-- MATH
 $4 \times 1/64 = 1/16$
 -->
 (6.2%). 

<P>
<B>Selection with sorting.</B> 
<BR><B>QS6.</B> Select nodes with <I>aLevel = 13</I> and have the returned nodes
sorted by <I>aSixtyFour</I> attribute.  Selectivity is 6.0%. 

<P>
<B>Multiple-attribute selection.</B> 
<BR><B>QS7.</B> Select nodes with
attributes <I>aSixteen = 1</I> and <I>aFour = 1</I>. Selectivity is <!-- MATH
 $1/16 \times 1/4 = 1/64$
 -->
 (1.6%).

<P>
<B>Element Name Selection</B> 
<BR><B>QS8.</B> Select nodes with the element
name  <I>eOccasional</I>. Selectivity is 1/64 (1.6%) since <I>eOccasional</I> appears nested under the element with <I>aSixtyFour = 0</I> and the probability of <I>aSixtyFour = 0</I> is 1/16. 

<P>
<B>Element Content Selection</B> 
<BR><B>QS9.</B> Select nodes that have <I>``oneB4''</I> as a substring of element 
content.
The probability of <I>``oneB4"</I> being picked 1/128.
Although this string can also arise in bucket
16, the probability there is much smaller , and hence
can be ignored. There are 16 ``PickWord''s in the content of
each element, so 16 opportunities for this predicate to be satisfied at
each element, giving an overall selectivity of 16/128 (12.5%).
Selectivity is 12.5%. 

<P>
<B>QS10.</B> Select <I>OccasionalType</I> nodes that  have <I>``oneB4''</I> in the element content. 
Since there is approximately one <I>OccasionalType</I> node in every 64 <I>BaseType</I> nodes, 
the overall selectivity is <!-- MATH
 $(16/128) \times (1/64) = 1/512$
 -->
 (0.2%).
Selectivity is 0.2%.

<P>
<B>Order-based Selection</B> 
<BR><B>QS11.</B> Select the second child of every node with <I>aLevel = 7</I>.
At leve 7, each node has thirteen children.  These children are at level 8 which has the number of nodes = 4.8% of all nodes.  Thus, the selectivity of this query is <!-- MATH
 $4.8 \times 1/13$
 -->
 = 0.4%.  

<P>
<B>QS12.</B> Select the second child of every node with <I>aLevel = 9</I>.
At level 9, each node has two children.  These children are at level 10 which has the number of nodes = 0.7% of all nodes.  Thus, the selectivity of this query is 0.7%  = 0.4%.  

<P>
Since the fraction
of nodes in these two queries are the same, 
the performance difference between
queries QS11 and QS12 is likely to be on account of fanout. 

<P>
<B>String Distance Selection</B> 
<BR><B>QS13.</B> Select all nodes with element content that the distance between keyword <I>``oneB2''</I> and keyword <I>``twenty''</I> is not more than four. 
There are two occurrences of ``PickWord'' within four words of <I>``twenty''</I> and
14 occurrences that are further away.  The probability of any one
occurrence of ``oneB2'' being selected is 1/32. 
Thus, the overall selectivity is <!-- MATH
 $(1/32) \times 2 = 1/16$
 -->
 (6.2%).
Selectivity is 6.2%. 

<P>
<B>QS14.</B> Select all nodes with element content that the distance between keyword <I>``oneB5"</I> and keyword <I>``twenty"</I> is not more than four.
The probability of any one occurrence of ``oneB5'' being selected 
 is 1/256.
Thus, the overall selectivity is <!-- MATH
 $(1/256) \times 2 =  1/128$
 -->
 (0.8%).
Selectivity is 0.8%.
