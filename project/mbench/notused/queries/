Aggregate Queries</A>
</H2>
Aggregate queries are very important for data warehousing
applications.  In XML, aggregation also has richer possibilities due to the
structure.  These are explored in the next set of queries.

<P>
<B>QA1. Value Aggregation.</B> 
Compute the average value for the <I>aSixtyFour</I>
attribute of all nodes at level 15.  Note that about 1/4 of all nodes
are at level 15. The number of returned nodes is 1. 

<P>
<B>QA2. Value Aggregation with Groupby.</B> Group nodes by level. 
Compute the average value of the <I>aSixtyFour</I> attribute of all nodes at each level.  The return structure is a tree, with a dummy root and a child for
each group.  Each leaf (child) node has one attribute for the level and one
attribute for the average value.  The number of returned trees is 16. 

<P>
<B>QA3. Structural Aggregation.</B> Amongst the nodes at level 11,
find the node(s) with the largest fanout.  1/64 of the nodes are at level 11.  
Most nodes at this level have exactly two children.  But 1/64 of these nodes also have aq third child, of type <I>eOccasional</I>.  These are the nodes that must be returned. Thus, Selectivity is 1/64 * 1/64 = 1/4096 (0.02%).

<P>
<B>QA4. Value Aggregate Selection.</B> Select elements that have at
least two occurrences of keyword ``<I>oneB1</I>'' in their content.
There are 16 ``PickWord''s in the element content.  The probability that ``PickWord''
is replaced with ``<I>oneB1</I>'' is 1/16, and the probability that ``PickWord''
is not replaced with ``<I>oneB1</I>'' is 15/16.
 $P_n(``{\sf oneB1}'')$
 -->
 be the probability that there are  occurrences of
``<I>oneB1</I>.''   Then, <!-- MATH
 $P_n(``{\sf oneB1}'')$
 -->
 = <!-- MATH
 ${16\choose n} \times(1/16)^n\times(15/16)^{16-n}$
 -->
. 
The probability that there are at least two occurrences of ``<I>oneB1</I>'' is 
<!-- MATH
 $1 - P_0(``{\sf oneB1}'') - P_1(``{\sf oneB1}'')$
 -->
 = 1 - 0.36 - 0.38 = 0.26.  
Thus, the selectivity of this query is 0.26%. Selectivity is 0.26%. 

<P>
<B>QA5. Structural Aggregate Selection.</B> Select elements that have at
least two children that satisfy <I>aFour = 1</I>.
About 50% of the database nodes are at level 16 and have no children.
Except about 2% of the remainder, all have exactly two children, and both
must satisfy the predicate for the node to qualify.
The selectivity of the predicate is 1/4.  So the overall
selectivity of this query is 
<!-- MATH
 $(1/2) \times (1/4) \times (1/4) ~=~ 1/32 (3.1\%)$
 -->
.

<P>
<B>QA6. Structural Exploration.</B> For each node at level 7, determine
the height of the sub-tree rooted at this node.  The returned structure is a
tree with a dummy root that has a child for each node at level 7.  This child
leaf node has one attribute that references the node at level 7, and another
attribute that records the height of the sub-tree.
There are only 2,704 nodes at
level 7, irrespective of the database scaling.  Under each of these nodes, the
sub-tree goes to level 16, and so is exactly ten levels high, again
irrespective of the scaling.  However, determining this height may require
exploring substantial parts of the database.  Nodes at leve 7 are 0.4% of all nodes, thus the selectivity of this query is 0.4%. 

<P>
There are also other functionalities, such as casting, which can
be significant performance factors for engines that need to convert data types.  However, in this benchmark, we focus
on testing the core functionality of the XML engines.
