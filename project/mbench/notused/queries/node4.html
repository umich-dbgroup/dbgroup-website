Structural Selection Queries</A>
</H3>
Selection in XML is often based on patterns.  Queries should be
constructed to consider multi-node patterns of various sorts and
selectivities.  
These patterns often have ``conditional selectivity.'' 
Consider a simple two node selection pattern. Given
that one of the nodes has been identified, 
the selectivity of the second node in the pattern can differ from its
selectivity in the database as a whole.  
Similar dependencies between different attributes in a relation could exist,
thereby affecting the selectivity of a multi-attribute predicate.
Conditional selectivity is complicated in XML
because different attributes may not be in the same element, but rather in
different elements that are structurally related.

<P>
In this section, all queries return only the root of the selection pattern,
unless otherwise specified.
</I>
<UL>
<LI><B>Parent-child Selection</B> 
<BR><B>QS15. Medium selectivity of both parent and child.</B> 
Select nodes
with <I>aLevel = 13</I> that have a child with <I>aSixteen
= 3.</I>  Both the first predicate and the second predicate have  
a selectivity of 1/16.  Since each node at
level 13 has two children, there are two opportunities to satisfy the
child predicate.  Therefore the overall selectivity of this query is
 (1/16) * (1/16) * 2 = 1/128
 (0.8%). 

<P>
<B>QS16. High selectivity of parent and low selectivity of child.</B>  
Select
nodes with <I>aLevel = 15</I> that have a child with <I>aSixtyFour = 3</I>.  The first predicate and the second predicate have a selectivity of 1/4 and 1/64 respectively.
Following the
same argument as above, the selectivity of the query as a whole is 
still 1/128 (0.8%). Selectivity is 0.8%.  

<P>
<B>QS17. Low selectivity of parent and high selectivity of child.</B> 
Select
nodes with <I>aLevel = 11</I> that have a child with <I>aFour = 3</I>.  The first predicate and the second predicate have a selectivity of 
1/64 and 1/4 respectively.  Following the
same argument as above, the selectivity of the query as a whole is
still 1/128 (0.8%). Selectivity is 0.8%. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Order-sensitive Parent-child Selection</B>  
<BR><B>QS18. Local Ordering.</B> 
Select the second element 
below <EM>each</EM> element with <I>aFour = 1</I> if that second element also has <I>aFour = 1</I>.  
Let n_l  is the number of nodes at level  and f_l is the number of fanout at level.  
Then, the number of the second element nodes is 
 the sum of (n_l) * (1/f_{l-1}) from l=2 to l=16,  which is approximately 1/2.

<P>
Since the selectivity of the element with <I>aFour =1</I> is 1/4, the
probability that the second element that has <I>aFour = 1</I> and that
its parent has <I>aFour = 1</I> is 1/16.  Thus, the overall selectivity
of this query is  
 (1/2) * (1/16) = 1/32
 (3.1%). 

<P>
<B>QS19. Global Ordering.</B> 
Select the second element with <I>aFour = 1</I>
below
<EM>any</EM> element with <I>aSixtyFour = 1</I>.  This query returns at most one
element, whereas the previous query returns one for each parent.  

<P>
<B>QS20. Reverse Ordering.</B>  
Among the children with <I>aSixteen = 1</I> of 
the parent element with <I>aLevel = 13</I>, select the last child.  Approximately 1/16 of the nodes are at
level 13, and each has two children.  Almost 1/8 of these will have at least
one child that satisfies the former predicate (from among whom the last one
must be returned in this query).  Thus, the overall query selectivity is
 1/128 (0.8%). Selectivity is 0.8%. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Ancestor-Descendant Selection</B> 
<BR><B>QS21. Medium selectivity of both ancestor and descendant.</B> 
Select nodes with <I>aLevel = 13</I> that have a descendant with
<I>aSixteen = 3</I>.
The first predicate has selectivity
of 0.06. 
Since each node at level 13 has 14
descendants, the probability that none of these 14 nodes satisfy the second
predicate is 
 1 - (1/16)^{14}.
 Thus, the probability that a given 
selected ancestor node has any descendant that satisfies the second predicate 
is 
 1 - (1 - (1/16)^{14})
Therefore, the overall selectivity is 
 0.06 * (1 - (1 -
(1/16))^{14})
 = 3.6%.  

<P>
<B>QS22. High selectivity of ancestor and low selectivity of descendant.</B> 
Select nodes with <I>aLevel = 15</I> that have a descendant with <I>aSixtyFour = 3</I>.
The first predicate has a selectivity of 0.24.
Since a node at level 15 only has no descendant other than
its own two children, the probability that none of these two nodes satisfy the 
second predicate is .    
The overall selectivity is 
 0.24 * (1 - (1 - (1/64))^2)
= 0.7%. 

<P>
<B>QS23. Low selectivity of ancestor and high selectivity of descendant.</B>
Select nodes with <I>aLevel = 11</I> that have a descendant with  <I>aFour = 3</I>.
The first predicate has selectivity of 1.5.
Since each
level 11 node has 62 descendants, the probability that none of these 62 nodes
satisfy the second predicate is 
 1 - (1/4)^{62}.
The selectivity of the query as a whole is 
 1.5 * (1 - (1 -
(1/4))^{62})
 = 1.5%. 
</LI>
<LI><B>Ancestor Nesting in Ancestor-Descendant Selection</B> 
<BR>
In the ancestor-descendant queries above (QS21-QS23), ancestors are never nested below
other ancestors.  To test the performance of queries when ancestors are
recursively nested below other ancestors,  we have three other
ancestor-descendant queries.  These queries are variants of 
QS21-QS23. 

<P>
<B>QS24. Medium selectivity of both ancestor and descendant.</B>
Select nodes with <I>aSixteen = 3</I> that have a descendant with <I>aSixteen = 3</I>.  

<P>
<B>QS25. High selectivity of ancestor and low selectivity of descendant.</B>
Select nodes with <I>aFour = 3</I> that have a descendant with <I>aSixtyFour = 3</I>.  

<P>
<B>QS26. Low selectivity of ancestor and high selectivity of descendant.</B>
Select nodes with <I>aSixtyFour = 9</I> that have a descendant with 
<I>aFour = 3</I>.  

<P>
The overall selectivities of these queries (QS24-QS26) cannot be the same as
that of the ``equivalent'' unnested queries (QS21-QS23) for two situations -
first, the same descendants can now have multiple ancestors they
match, and second, the number of candidate descendants is
different (fewer) since the ancestor predicate can be satisfied by
nodes at any level.  
These two situations may
not necessary cancel each other out. We
focus on the local predicate selectivities and keep
these the same for all of these queries (as well as for the
parent-child queries considered before).
</LI>
<LI><B>Return Structure in Structural Pattern Selection Query:</B>
<BR><B>QS27.</B> Similar to query QS26, but return 
both the root node and the descendant node of the selection pattern.  Thus, the returned structure is a pair of nodes
with an inclusion relationship between them.
</LI>
<LI><B>Complex Pattern Selection Queries:</B> 
<BR>
Complex pattern matches are common in XML databases, and in this section, 
we introduce a number of <EM>chain</EM> and <EM>twig</EM> queries that we use 
in this benchmark.
For complex pattern queries, we use a combination of chain and twig queries. 
<a
 href="icons/chainTwig.jpg">Figure</A> shows an example of each of these types of queries. 
In the figure, each node represents a predicate such as an element tag name 
predicate, or an attribute value predicate, or an element content match predicate.
A structural parent-child relationship in the query is shown by a single 
line, and an ancestor-descendant relationship is represented by a double-edged
line. The chain query shown in the <a href="icons/chainTwig.jpg">Figure (i)</a> finds all nodes that match the condition
A, such that there is a child node that matches the condition B, such that some 
descendant of the child node matches the condition C. The twig query shown in the 
<a href="icons/chainTwig.jpg">Figure(ii)</a> matches all nodes that satisfy the condition A, and have a child node 
that satisfies the condition B, and also has a descendant node that satisfies 
the condition C. 
<BR>
We use the following complex queries in our benchmark: 
<BR><B>QS28. One chain query with three parent-child joins with the selectivity pattern: high-low-low-high.</B> 
The query is to test the choice of join order in evaluating a complex query. To achieve the desired selectivities, we use the following predicates:  <I>aFour=3</I>, <I>aSixteen=3</I>, <I>aSixteen=5</I> and <I>aLevel=16</I>. The probability of <I>aFour = 3</I> is 1/4, and of <I>aSixteen = 3(5)</I> is 1/16, and the probability of <I>aLevel = 16</I> is 0.47.  Thus, the selectviity of this query is 
 (1/4)  * (1/16) * (1/16) * 0.47
 = 0.0%.

<P>
<B>QS29. One twig query with two parent-child selection (low-high, low-low).</B>
Select parent nodes with <I>aLevel=11</I> (low selectivity) that have  a child with <I>aFour=3</I> (high selectivity), and another child with <I>aSixtyFour=3</I> (low selectivity). The probability of <I>aLevel = 11</I> is 0.015, that of <I>aFour =3</I> is 1/4, and that of <I>aSixtyFour=3</I> is 1/64.  Thus, the selectivity of this query is 
 0.015 * 1/4  * 1/64
 = 0.0%.
</I>
<P>
<B>QS30. One twig query with two parent-child selection (high-low, high-low).</B>
Select parent nodes with 
<I>aFour=1</I> (high selectivity) that have a child with <I>aLevel=11</I> (low selectivity) and 
another child with <I>aSixtyFour=3</I> (low selectivity). The probability of <I>aFour=1</I> is 0.25, that of <I>aLevel=11</I> is 0.015, and that of <I>aSixtyFour=3</I> is 1/64.  Thus, the selectivity of this query is 
 0.25 * 0.015 * 1/64
 = 0.0%. 
<P>
<B>QS31-QS33.</B> Repeat queries QS28-QS30, but using ancestor-descendant in place of
parent-child. 
<P>
For QS32, the first predicate has selectivity of 0.015.
Since a node at level 11 has 62 descendants.
The probability that none of these descendants satisfy <I>aFour=3</I> and <I>aS
ixtyFour = 3</I> are
 (1 - (1 - 1/4))^{62} and
 (1 - (1 - 1/64))^{62}
), respectively.
Thus, the overall selectivity is 
 0.015 * (1 - (1 - (1/4))^{62} * (1 -
 (1 - 1/64))^{62}
 = 0.9%.
<P>
<B>QS34. One twig query with one parent-child selection and one ancestor-descendant selection.</B> Select nodes with <I>aFour=1</I> that have a child of nodes with <I>aLevel=11</I>, and a descendant with <I>aSixtyFour = 3</I> 
<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Negated Selection Queries:</B> 
<BR><B>QS35.</B>  Find all <I>BaseType</I> elements below which 
there is no <I>OccasionalType</I> element.
