In creating the data set above, we make it possible
to tease apart data with different characteristics, and to issue
queries with well-controlled yet vastly differing data access
patterns.  
We are more interested in the evaluating the cost of individual pieces of core query functionality than in the evaluating the composite performance of queries that are of application-level.   Knowing the costs of individual basic operations, we can estimate the cost of any
complex query by just adding up relevant piecewise costs (keeping in
mind the pipelined nature of evaluation, and the changes in sizes of
intermediate results when operators are pipelined).

<P>
One clean way to decompose complex queries is by means of an algebra.
While the benchmark is not tied to any particular algebra, we find it
useful to refer to queries as ``selection queries'', ``join queries''
and the like, to clearly indicate the functionality 
of each query.  A complex query that involves many of these
simple operations can take time that varies monotonically
with the time required for these simple components.

<P>
In the following subsections, we describe each of these different types of queries in detail.
In these queries, the types of the nodes are assumed to be <I>BaseType</I> 
(<code>eNest</code> nodes) unless specified otherwise.

<P>
Each of the benchmark queries was carefully chosen to have a desired
selectivity.  
For this purpose, we will frequently need to determine the probability of
``PickWord'', based on the uniform distribution of buckets and words in each
bucket.
  For example, if
``PickWord'' is <I>``oneB1''</I>, this indicates that this ``PickWord'' is the first
word in bucket 1.  Since there are 16 buckets, and there is only one word in
the first bucket the probability of <I>``oneB1''</I> being picked is 1/16 <!-- MATH
 $(1/16
\times 1)$
 -->
.  Since there are eight words in the fourth bucket (), the
probability of <I>``oneB4''</I> being picked is 1/128  <!-- MATH
 $(1/16 \times 1/8)$
 -->
.
