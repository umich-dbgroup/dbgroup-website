<h2>Transformation to Simplified ER Diagrams</h2>
<p>For simplicity of exposition, especially in the translation of ER
diagrams to MCT schemas in the paper, it is useful to focus
attention on simplified ER diagrams, that contain only entity types, binary
relationship types between distinct entity or relationship types,
and atomic attributes. Arbitrary ER diagrams can be translated
into such simplified ER diagrams by repeatedly applying the following
transformations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
A <em>k</em>-ary (<em>k</em>>2) relationship type <em>R</em> between <em>k</em> entity
(or relationship) types <em>E<sub>1</sub>,..., E<sub>k</sub></em> is replaced by a
new entity type <em>E<sub>R</sub></em>, with k new relationship types <em>R<sub>1</sub>,
,... R<sub>k</sub></em>, where each <em>R<sub>i</sub></em> is a <em>1:n</em> binary relationship
type between <em>E<sub>i</sub></em> and <em>E<sub>R</sub></em>.
</li>


<li>
A binary relationship type <em>R</em> in which an entity (or relationship)
type <em>E</em> participates more than once is replaced by a new
entity type <em>E<sub>R</sub></em>, with two new binary relationship types <em>R<sub>1</sub></em>,
<em>R<sub>2</sub></em>, where each <em>R<sub>i</sub></em> corresponds to one of the original roles
of <em>R</em>, linking <em>E</em> and <em>E<sub>R</sub></em>.
The cardinality of an <em>R<sub>i</sub></em> is the same as that of <em>R</em>'s
original role.
</li>


<li>
Composite attributes are replaced by new entity types that
are linked to their original entity type by new binary
relationship types.
This is done since the XML data model does not support composite
attributes to be associated with elements.
</li>

</ul>
<p>Note that the TPC-W ER diagram of Figure 1 in the paper is
already in the desired simplified form.</p>
