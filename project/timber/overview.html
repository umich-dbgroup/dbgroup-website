      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The central idea in the Timber project is to construct an XML database 
        that has an architecture as close as possible to that of a relational 
        database. In this way, we attempt to reuse, where appropriate, the technologies 
        developed for relational databases over the past several decades. See 
        (<a href="files/timber.pdf">Timber overview</a>) for an overview of the 
        project. </p>
      <p>Relational Algebra plays a central role in relational database implementation. 
        An equivalent algebra for XML is developed in <a href="files/tax_full.pdf">TAX</a>. 
        This algebra manipulates sets of ordered labeled trees, rather than sets 
        of tuples. The primary difficulties addressed include the complex and 
        variable structure of trees in a set, and issues of ordering. </p>
      <p>Once a query has been parsed into an algebraic representation, this algebraic 
        expression is manipulated in a query optimizer, which then chooses an 
        appropriate query plan to evaluate the query. The (<a href="files/optimization.pdf">Query 
        optimization for XML</a>) points out some key differences for XML query 
        otimization vis-a-vis relational optimization. </p>
      <p>Cost-based query optimization requires good size estimates for query 
        results and intermediate results. Due to the complex structure of XML 
        data, obtaining these estimates is not necessarily straightforward. Techniques 
        for obtaining such estimates effectively are discussed in (<a href="files/yEDBT02.pdf">Estimating 
        answer sizes for XML queries</a> and <a href="files/twig-icde2001.pdf">Counting 
        Twig Matches in a Tree</a>). </p>
      <p>XML query evaluation often involves the computation of a structural join. 
        One has to determine the satisfaction of predicates at multiple structurally 
        related elements in the database. New access methods for the computation 
        of such joins are introduced in (<a href="files/sICDE02.pdf">Structural 
        Joins</a> and <a href="files/comboperators.pdf">Combining Operators in 
        XML Query Processing</a>). </p>
