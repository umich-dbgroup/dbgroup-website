XML has become ubiquitous, and XML data has to be managed in databases.
The current industry standard is to map XML data into relational tables and
store this information in a relational database.  Such mappings create both
expressive power problems (such as requiring transitive closure computations
to compute ancestor-descendant relationships) and performance problems (for
instance to reconstruct XML for output).

In the TIMBER project we are exploring the issues involved in storing XML in
native format.  We recognize XML documents to be trees, and build a system to 
manipulate collections of trees.  In doing so, we attempt to avoid the
pitfall of "instance-at-a-time" navigational access.  Rather, we attempt to
bring to bear the core ideas of database technology, such as declarative
querying, a bulk algebra, and cost-based query optimization.  We do not yet
have a fully functional system, but large portions are working and initial
results are very promising.
