<p>In Figure 2, +,* in front of the lines indicate
differences from the original BUC Algorithm corresponding to the
adaptation to support the two properties of XML data mentioned
before. In (1*), all duplicate facts are eliminated before the
aggregation is computed from the fact attributes. In (4.1+) and
(4.2+), we ignore witness trees that have missing dimensions.
Ancestors that contain missing dimensions are ignored in (2.1+).
Only (1*), which is a support for the non-disjointness property,
creates an overhead. We can see that if each grouping tree
comprises a large number of individual witness trees, i.e. if the
cube is sparse, duplicate elimination can be a bottleneck for this
algorithm.</p>

<font size="+1">Top-Down Based Algorithm</font><br>
<p>+,* in front of the lines indicate
differences from the original Memory-Cube Algorithm corresponding to the adaptation previously mentioned. In Figure 3, we do not
aggregate trees that have one or more axes that do not comply to
the pattern of the accumulator in Line 2.3.3.1+*. For line 2.1*,
the accumulators are initialized to contain the fact items. Due to
the non-disjointness of grouped partition, in Line 2.3.3.1+* and
2.3.4*, the fact identifiers are retained, to ignore duplicates.</p>
