			<h1 class="title">Appearance Frequency Modulated Gene Set Enrichment Testing</h1>
			<div class="entry">
				<h2 class="subtitle">Abstract:</h2>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>Gene set enrichment analysis has helped bridge the gap from an individual gene to 
				systems biology interpretation of microarray data. Although gene sets are defined a 
				priori based on biological knowledge, all genes are treated as equal in current methods. 
				However, it is well-known that some genes, such as those responsible for housekeeping 
				functions, appear in many pathways, whereas other genes are more specialized and play 
				a unique role in a single pathway.</p>
				<p>Drawing inspiration from the field of information retrieval, we develop an approach 
				to incorporate gene appearance frequency (in KEGG) into the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis 
				(GSEA) and logistic regression-based LRpath framework to generate more reproducible and 
				biologically meaningful results.</p>
				
				<h3>Results</h3>
				<p>Two breast cancer microarray datasets were analyzed to identify gene sets associated 
				with the differentiation of histological grade 1 and 3 breast cancer. The correlation of 
				Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) between gene sets, generated by original GSEA and GSEA 
				with the appearance frequency of gene incorporated (GSEA-AF), was compared. GSEA-AF 
				resulted in a higher correlation between experiments and more overlapping top gene sets. 
				Several cancer related gene sets achieved higher NES in GSEA-AF as well. The same datasets 
				were also analyzed by LRpath and LRpath with the appearance frequency of gene incorporated 
				(LRpath-AF). Two well-studied lung cancer datasets were also analyzed in the same manner 
				to demonstrate the validity of the method, and similar results were obtained.</p>
				
				<h3>Conclusions</h3>
				<p>We introduced an alternative way to integrate KEGG PATHWAY information into gene set 
				enrichment analysis. The performance of GSEA and LRpath can be enhanced with the integration 
				of appearance frequency of genes. We conclude that, generally, gene set analysis methods 
				with the integration of information from KEGG PATHWAY performs better both statistically 
				and biologically.</p>
