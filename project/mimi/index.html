          <td valign=top> <b> Biological Texts: </b> </td>
          <td valign=top> There is a great deal of interest on understanding
            biological texts automatically.  There are also a large number of biological
            databases dealing with a vairety of topics.  The goal of our porject
            is to be able to combine these two efforts by storing the information
            extracted from the text parsing into an XML database with a proper
            data model.  With all the information managed by a database engine,
            complex queries can be issued and data mining can be applied.

          <td valign=top>Protein data, from sequence and structure to interaction, is being generated 
            through many diverse methodologies; it is stored and reported in numerous forms and multiple 
            places.  The magnitude of the data limits researchers abilities to utilize all information 
            generated. Effective integration of protein data can be accomplished through better data 
            modeling. Using an appropriate data model can enable researchers to exploit data more fully. 
            Using <a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/db/timber/">TIMBER</a> as our repository, we are 
            developing a data model which allows fuller usage of the current protein data.
