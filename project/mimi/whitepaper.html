<P>
There is a proliferation of data sources in biology.  Each research group and
each new experimental technique seems to generate yet another source of
valuable data.  This data is not represented in any standard format.
Usually it is not possible to define a tightly-specified standard format that
is general enough to anticipate the needs of this new data sources.
Even when open standards such as XML are used to represent data, they are
frequently in the form of customized, source-specific, schemas.  Moreover,
schemas themselves change frequently, as knowledge in the field evolves, and
new attributes are found to be of importance.  Researchers relying on the
integration of data from multiple such sources need help.
<P>
Even researchers conducting experiments, and therefore quite likely
interested in a comparatively limited class of sources of data, need help.
Since experiments are expensive to conduct, reuse of data is desirable
whenever possible, for instance by patching together information derived from
multiple previous experiments conducted for possibly different purposes.
Effectively performing such data integration requires good metadata
annotation with respect to experimental conditions and similar other
information regarding each data set in question.  However, such annotations
are frequently missing.  Even when present, they are frequently incomplete
and never standardized.
<P>
Some standards for meta-data specification are beginning to emerge.  For
instance, MESH is used widely to annotate medical literature, and UMLS has
been proposed as the next step beyond it.  Drug ontologies have been
developed based on chemical components and on functional characterization.
While development of a standardized domain-specific ontology is of value,
there is much information that such ontologies are not likely to capture.  For
instance, details of the experimental conditions, possibly considered
trivial at the time of the experiment itself, may turn out to be crucial
at a later time.  No ontology is likely to have a priori captured such
detail.
<P>
In addition to metadata regarding the environment, the experiment, and
so forth, there is also considerable local metadata that could be
associated with individual data items (or sets of data items).  For
instance, scientists may often wish to annotate specific readings, by
way of explanation, or to record an insight not evident from just the
numbers.  Similarly, data can be of variable quality, due to
experimental error of various sorts, and also because science progresses
by advancing hypotheses not all of which are eventually substantiated.
We should provide facilities to maintain data provenance to enable
tracing the derivation of each item in a database.  We should also keep
track of reliability quantitatively, through the association of
probabilities, and similar other quantitative expressions.
<P>
At the University of Michigan, we have been studying these issues, and
currently have partial solutions in place, based on our
<a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/db/timber">Timber</a>  XML data
management project.  Specifically, we are able to
capture quantitative and qualitative reliability information associated with
facts at any granularity
[<a href="http://www.eecs.umich.edu/db/timber/files/protdb.pdf">ProTDB</a>].
We are also able to represent the experimental technique used to obtain the
data, along with relevant environmental factors that may be important in
future interpretation of the data.
<P>
Using the above as a basis, we have begun to address the problem of
integrating the large amount of  web accessible data available to the
biological enterprise, focusing specifically on protein interaction data.
We find that there is significant overlap in content among sources as well as
innumerable links connecting the source contents to each other.  We are
developing new data representation and integration techniques that permit
effective integrated representation of such disparate overlapping data, along
with all of the environmental and reliability annotations mentioned above.
